# Fix Plan

> Prioritized task list for autonomous development loop.
> Mark items `[x]` as you complete them.

## High Priority

- [ ] Set up basic project structure
- [ ] Define core data structures
- [ ] Implement primary feature
- [ ] Add error handling for critical paths

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Implement secondary features
- [ ] Add configuration support
- [ ] Write user documentation

## Lower Priority

- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Additional integrations
- [ ] Extended error recovery
- [ ] Nice-to-have features

## Completed

_Move completed items here for tracking_

---

## Notes

- Focus on high priority items first
- Each loop should complete at least one item
- Update this file as work progresses
- Add new items as discovered during development
