# Research Task

Perform thorough research and analysis before implementation.

## Research Process

1. **Understand the Request**
   - Parse the research question/topic
   - Identify key concepts and requirements
   - Note any constraints or preferences

2. **Explore the Codebase**
   - Find relevant files and modules
   - Understand current architecture
   - Identify patterns and conventions
   - Map dependencies between components

3. **Identify Affected Areas**
   - List files that would need changes
   - Identify potential breaking changes
   - Note integration points
   - Consider test coverage implications

4. **Analyze Options**
   - Consider multiple implementation approaches
   - Evaluate pros/cons of each
   - Consider maintainability, performance, and complexity
   - Research best practices if needed

5. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify potential risks
   - Consider edge cases
   - Note areas needing extra testing
   - Flag security considerations

DO NOT implement anything. This is research only - output a detailed analysis that can inform implementation decisions.
